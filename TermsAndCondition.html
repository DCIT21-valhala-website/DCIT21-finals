All Products shown on the Website are subject to availability. This means that, although we strive to ensure our Website reflects the availability of stock, a Product shown on the Website may no longer be available for purchase.

                <p class="indent-2">
                    <span>2.4.1 General aspect of our Contact Formation</span><br>
                    The following applies to all types of products. All information on the Website is an invitation to treat only. In other words, the information is not an offer or binding contract. You agree that your order is an offer to purchase the Products listed in your order. All orders submitted by you are subject to acceptance by us. We are entitled to verify an order in advance at all times and/or to refuse to accept an order without providing reasons and with no liability to you or any third parties. If we do not confirm acceptance of your order within ten working days, it is deemed to have been refused.<br>
                    <br>
                    We may choose not to accept your order at our own discretion. Examples of when we may not accept your order are as follows:<br>
                    1. If Product(s) are shown on the Website but are not or no longer available;<br>
                    2. If we are unable to obtain authorization of your payment;<br>
                    3. If shipping restrictions may apply to a Product;<br>
                    4. If Product(s) shown on the Website contain a manifest error such as being incorrectly priced or other wise incorrectly described;<br>
                    <br>
                    In the event that we do not accept (part of) your order we shall be entitled to cancel (part of) your order without incurring any liability towards you or a third party. Following the cancellation we will of course provide you with a refund for the amount paid to us under the cancelled (part of the) order. We reserve the right to cancel your order after the creation of the contract of sale, thereby terminating the contract of sale, for the reasons stipulated in this section 2.4.1. under headings a through d above. Following the cancellation we will of course provide you with a refund for the amount paid to us under the cancelled (part of the) order. Valhalla Streets has and fully reserves the right to refuse to accept any order that it knows or reasonably suspects was made with the assistance or involvement of any software, robot, crawler, spider or other automated means or device.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span>2.4.2 Special Aspects of Contract Formation for Products</span><br>
                    After your order has been placed, we will send you an order acknowledgement email with your order number and details of the Products you have offered to purchase and details of any delivery services. Acceptance of your order and the formation of a contract of sale of the Products between you and us will not take place unless and until either:<br>
                    <br>
                    1. You receive an email from us confirming that the Products have been dispatched to you (the "Dispatch Confirmation"); or<br>
                    2. You receive an email from the carrier that the product are ready for pick-up.<br>
                    3. If you have chosen to pick up the product in a store, you will receive an email from the store that the product are ready for pick-up.<br>
                    <br>
                    Please note that the Click & Collect functionality available on the Website in your country, may not include the option for you to order and pay for the Product on the Website (as described under clause 2.4.2 c), but give you the option to reserve a Product on the Website and to then buy and thus pay for it locally in an valhalla streets store. This Click & Collect reservation is only possible in selected valhalla streets stores as indicated during the checkout process on the Website. If you buy the reserved product, you are concluding a purchase agreement with the valhalla streets retailer of your choice locally. This means that you can only return the Product(s) to the same store you bought it from, subject to the return policy of that store. Therefore sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 below do not apply because they apply only to the return of Products purchased through the Website.<br>

You may not sell, dispose of or encumber any Product before full title thereof has passed to you.<br>

                    We will deliver to the address indicated by you within Philippines. We can only deliver to a home or office address or a carrier pickup location or if you have chosen to collect the Products from an valhalla streets store, to the address of the relevant valhalla streets store. We will confirm this to you by an email when informing you that the Products are ready for you to pick up. If a delivery attempt is unsuccessful, you agree that the carrier we have engaged for the delivery may also deliver the Products to a neighbouring/nearby address or pick-up point, after which valhalla streets is deemed to have met its obligation to deliver the Products. The carrier will notify you of the delivery to the neighbouring/nearby address or pick-up point.
                    Free Shipping is available for standard delivery for orders above a minimum spend of PHP3000 (subject to revision from time to time at our sole discretion). There will be no shipping charges if you choose to click and collect from our stores.<br>
                    Shipment of orders will take place on business days, not being a public holiday in the area in which our warehouse is located.

Deliveries will be made on business days, not being a public holiday. <br>
                    For detailed information about delivery periods, please check the specifications for the different types of delivery on the Delivery section of our Website. Delivery periods are indicative and are therefore not regarded as strict deadlines. The mere fact that a delivery period is exceeded does not entitle you to compensation and you hereby waive your rights to claim. Notwithstanding this, in case of the unlikely event of delay in an Express delivery, we may, at our discretion, refund to you the full cost of Express delivery. This means that your complete order of Products will take longer to deliver. <br>
                    valhalla streets is entitled, insofar as reasonably possible, to make split deliveries so that you receive your Products as soon as possible. There are no additional costs associated with such split deliveries. However, in the event that you request that we deliver in parts, we may charge you for extra delivery costs. Each split order shall constitute a separate contract of sale. If we are late delivering a part or one split order is faulty, that will not entitle you to cancel any other part of split order.<br>
                    In the unlikely event that after entering into the contract of sale, we cannot, could not or can no longer deliver (part of) your order and are not responsible for this situation, we will be entitled to terminate the contract of sale. We will, of course, inform you as soon as reasonably practicable and reimburse any payments made.<br>
